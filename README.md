## About

The TypeScript tasks are in the `types.ts` file.

### Personal note/rant/whatever - just my thoughts

On the TypeScript part I totally sucked, I ain't no wizard. I tried to give it a shot but I'm just bad at it. I need to look over Matt Pocock's course.

I heard a lot of hype about `shadcn` and how it is so awesome and yada yada. I never used it before and I was really looking forward to try it, to be honest.

After this assignment I can say that it kinda fucking sucks. The CLi stuff is cool, ain't gonna lie, but that `Command` component killed me. And the docs are really poor, I have to jump thru 2 other docs and repos (radix and cmdk) just to make a list work. I get it, as a developer sifting thru documentation is half my job, but when using a UI library I would expect things to work.

Anyway, maybe I'm getting old and I can't keep up with all these flavor of the month UI libraries anymore.

I'm a big fan of `react-query`, best library ever imo. I didn't use as declaratively as I would like, had to resort to doing things in a more imperative style. Oh well..

Cool assingment tho.
